# Code Simplification Skill

Simplifies code to improve clarity and maintainability. Prioritizes readability over cleverness.

## Overview

This skill helps you refactor complex code into simpler, more understandable versions. It's about making code easier to read, reason about, and maintain—not about writing the shortest possible code. The goal is to remove unnecessary complexity while preserving functionality.

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "code simplification"
- "When code has overly complex logic that's hard to understand"
- "When there are unnecessary abstractions or layers"
- "When refactoring for readability during code review"


- When code has overly complex logic that's hard to understand
- When there are unnecessary abstractions or layers
- When refactoring for readability during code review
- When removing dead code or unused functionality
- When debugging and the code is too convoluted to follow
- When onboarding new developers and code is confusing

## The Process

1. **Identify complexity** – Read the code and pinpoint what makes it hard to understand (complex conditionals, nested logic, unclear naming, unnecessary abstractions)

2. **Simplify** – Refactor to improve clarity:
   - Rename variables/functions for clarity
   - Flatten nested conditionals
   - Extract complex expressions into named variables
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Replace clever tricks with straightforward approaches
   - Remove dead code and unused features

3. **Verify behavior unchanged** – Ensure functionality is preserved:
   - Run tests to confirm nothing broke
   - Manually verify behavior if no tests exist
   - Compare outputs before and after refactoring

4. **Commit** – Merge the simplification with a descriptive commit message

## When NOT to Use

- Task is about deployment, not development (use deploy skills)
- Task is about code review, not writing (use review skills)
- You need to understand existing code first (use research skills)
- Task is about testing only (use test skills)
- Requirements are unclear (clarify first)
- Task is trivially simple (single line fix)


## Red Flags

- **Simplifying working code without tests** – Removing complexity blindly can introduce bugs. Always have tests or verify behavior first.

- **Removing "unused" code that actually has hidden dependencies** – Just because code looks unused doesn't mean it's safe to delete. Check references, dynamic access, or runtime behavior.

- **Over-simplifying to the point of losing functionality** – Sometimes complexity exists for a reason. Simplify for clarity, not for the sake of fewer lines.

- **Refactoring without understanding** – Don't change code you don't understand. First understand the purpose, then simplify.

- **Making things "simpler" that are actually more fragile** – Simplicity should mean clearer intent, not fewer safeguards.

## Verification

- Tests pass after refactoring
- Behavior is unchanged (same inputs produce same outputs)
- Code is measurably simpler:
  - Fewer lines of code (where meaningful)
  - Lower cognitive complexity (decision points are easier to trace)
  - Clearer naming and structure
  - Reduced nesting and fewer conditional branches
- Code review feedback confirms improved readability
## Notes

- This skill integrates with the broader 1ai-skills ecosystem for development workflows
- Combine with related skills for maximum impact across your pipeline
- Monitor output quality and iterate on configuration based on results
- Keep dependencies up to date for security and performance
- Document custom workflows and configurations for team knowledge sharing

## Process

```python
# Example: TDD workflow
def test_user_creation():
    user = create_user(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
    assert user.name == "Alice"
    assert user.email == "alice@example.com"
    assert user.created_at is not None

def test_user_creation_invalid_email():
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        create_user(name="Alice", email="invalid")
```

1. Analyze the task requirements
2. Apply domain expertise
3. Verify output quality

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Tests slow me down" | Bugs slow you down 10x more. Tests are speed, not overhead. |
| "I will refactor later" | Technical debt compounds. Refactor as you go. |
| "It works on my machine" | If it is not in CI, it does not work. Ship proof, not claims. |
