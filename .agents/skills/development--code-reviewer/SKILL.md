# Code Reviewer Skill

## Overview

Perform professional code reviews targeting local changes or remote PRs to improve correctness and maintainability. This skill is based on the popular code-reviewer skill from playbooks.com.

**Purpose**: Professional code reviews  
**Scope**: Any codebase  
**Output**: Actionable feedback

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll figure it out as I go" | A structured approach saves time and reduces errors. Follow the workflow in this skill rather than improvising. |
| "I already know this topic" | Familiarity breeds shortcuts. Use the checklist to verify you haven't missed critical steps. |
| "This doesn't apply to my situation" | The patterns here generalize across contexts. Adapt, don't skip — the underlying principles hold. |
| "One more tool will fix it" | Adding complexity rarely solves process gaps. Master the core workflow first. |

## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "code reviewer"
- "Professional code review skill"


- Review PRs before merging
- Review local changes before committing
- Improve code quality
- Catch bugs early
- Ensure best practices

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial changes (< 10 lines, obvious fix) - quick self-review is enough
- Emergency hotfixes - review after deployment, not before
- Auto-generated code (formatting, builds) - review the generator instead
- WIP branches - wait until feature is complete
- Personal experiment branches that won't be merged

## Review Process

- Configure based, best, changes, code, community settings before first use


### 1. Gather Context
```
1. Identify the scope of changes
2. Understand the codebase structure
3. Check related tests
4. Look at dependency changes
```

### 2. Analyze Changes
```
1. Check for correctness
2. Look for edge cases
3. Verify error handling
4. Check security issues
5. Assess performance impact
```

### 3. Provide Feedback
```
1. Categorize issues (blocking, suggested, optional)
2. Provide specific examples
3. Suggest alternatives
4. Acknowledge good patterns
```

## Review Checklist

- Configure based, best, changes, code, community settings before first use


### Correctness
- Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are there potential runtime errors?
- Does it handle null/undefined?

### Security
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention
- Authentication/authorization
- Secrets management

### Performance
- Database queries optimization
- Memory usage
- Algorithmic complexity
- Caching opportunities

### Maintainability
- Code organization
- Naming conventions
- Comment quality
- Function complexity
- Test coverage

### Best Practices
- Language idioms
- Framework conventions
- Design patterns
- Error handling
- Logging

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is a trivial change, skip review" | Even 1-line changes can break production - always review |
| "I'll fix the small issues later" | Small issues accumulate - fix them now (Broken Windows Theory) |
| "The tests pass, that's enough" | Tests passing doesn't mean code is readable or maintainable |
| "I don't want to hurt their feelings" | Honest feedback makes better code - be kind but direct |
| "This follows the pattern used elsewhere" | If the pattern is wrong, don't replicate it - suggest improvement |
| "It's too late to change the architecture" | Better to fix it now than live with bad architecture longer |

## Red Flags

- Approving PRs without checking out the branch locally
- Review comments that only say "LGTM" or "Looks good"
- Skipping security review for auth/login changes
- Not running tests before approving
- Ignoring failing CI checks
- Approving code you don't understand
- Review time > 3 days for small PRs

## Best Practices

Recommended practices for code-reviewer.

- Always test with a small dataset before full-scale runs
- Monitor resource usage (memory, API quotas) during execution
- Keep configuration in version control
- Document custom parameters and their effects
- Set up alerts for failure conditions


### Do's
✅ Be specific and actionable  
✅ Provide code examples  
✅ Acknowledge good patterns  
✅ Consider the author's intent  
✅ Focus on important issues  

### Don'ts
❌ Don't be nitpicky  
❌ Don't rewrite code without explaining  
❌ Don't ignore context  
❌ Don't forget security

## Verification

After completing a code review, confirm:

- [ ] Review covers all changed files (none skipped)
- [ ] Each blocking issue (🔴) has clear fix suggestion with code example
- [ ] Security-sensitive changes (auth, payments, API) verified explicitly
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality (or explicit note why not)
- [ ] Linter passes on changed files (no type errors, no lint warnings)
- [ ] Review verdict is clear: **Approve** / **Request Changes** / **Approve with Comments**
- [ ] Author can act on feedback without needing clarification
